# Advent of Code

---

My advent of code soltions.

Used to learn julia, probably not optimal

---

### Usage

To run a problem do

```
./aoc <day> <problem> [year]
```

Where day is `1-25`, problem is `1 or 2 or test` and year is the year, defaulting to 2021

The program automatically downloads the input to `data/[year]/[day].txt` if it is not present, using a session cookie from a `.cookie` file in the project root
